# cryptohash-sha1  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hvr/cryptohash-sha1.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hvr/cryptohash-sha1)

A practical incremental and one-pass, pure API to the [SHA-1 hash
algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) (including
[HMAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) support) with performance
close to the fastest implementations available in other languages.
